Description: Interactive lessons to practice National Forest Inventory 
    sampling and data analysis. The lessons are based on a fictional island 
    that just emerged in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, and the users are 
    commissionned to inventory its forest resources. The underlying forest 
    measurements comes from the `eNFIrawdata` package, which contains 
    anonymized measurement in Tropical Forests.
